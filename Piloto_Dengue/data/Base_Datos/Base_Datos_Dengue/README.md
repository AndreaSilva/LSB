# Data base Dengue #

### Description ###

The database "bd_Dengue" contains all the cases registered of the Dengue virus in the GenBank database until September of 2016 generated on the search of the keyword "Dengue virus[organism]" with Rentrez package in R.

This database  has the description of the serotype, genotype, gen, country (with geographic coordinates), localization (with geographic coordinates), and date of every case.

The database is part of a research about Dengue virus genetics distances using free alignment methods. and their relation with the time and geographic development in the Systematics and Biogeographic laboratory of the Industrial University of Santander, Colombia.

**11.** country geographical coordinates (lat/long) (`lat_country` and `lon_country`):
The geographic coordinates were obtained from the names of the countries using the API Google Maps in R with the script coordenadas.R

**12.** country localization class (see below)(`locationtype_country`):
This information is obtained from the research of coordinates in Google Maps(API). This information is a description of the type of geographic coordinates found for Google Maps from the name of the country or localization, it can be three types forms. The following are the different location types:

 - "ROOFTOP" indicates that the returned result is a precise geocode for which we have location information accurate down to street address precision.
 - "RANGE_INTERPOLATED" indicates that the returned result reflects an approximation (usually on a road) interpolated between two precise points (such as intersections). Interpolated results are generally returned when rooftop geocodes are unavailable for a street address.
 - "GEOMETRIC_CENTER" indicates that the returned result is the geometric center of a result such as a polyline (for example, a street) or polygon (region).
 - "APPROXIMATE" indicates that the returned result is approximate.

**13.** country formatted (`formatted_country`):
Description of name place found on Google Maps for each original place of the database.

**14.** location geographical coordinates (lat/long) (`lat_location` and `lon_location`):
The geographic coordinates were obtained from the names of the localizations and your countries respectively using the API Google Maps in R with the script coordenadas.R

**15.** location localization class (see below) (`locationtype_country`):
This information is obtained from the research of coordinates in Google Maps(API). This information is a description of the type of geographic coordinates found for Google Maps from the name of the country or localization, it can be three types forms. The following are the different location types:

 - "ROOFTOP" indicates that the returned result is a precise geocode for which we have location information accurate down to street address precision.
 - "RANGE_INTERPOLATED" indicates that the returned result reflects an approximation (usually on a road) interpolated between two precise points (such as intersections). Interpolated results are generally returned when rooftop geocodes are unavailable for a street address.
 - "GEOMETRIC_CENTER" indicates that the returned result is the geometric center of a result such as a polyline (for example, a street) or polygon (region).
 - "APPROXIMATE" indicates that the returned result is approximate.

**16.** location formatted (`formatted_country`):
Description of name place found on Google Maps for each original place of the database.

**17.** Comments (`Comments`):
Orginal column downloaded from the GenBank with the information of country, locality, month and year of registration, as well as the source of isolation of each sample

----------------

### How was created this file: ###

- The information of the database was a download of GenBank on the search of the keyword "Dengue virus[organism]" using the Rentrez R package. (Implemented in: `bd_genbank.R`)

- The columns 'Country', 'Location', 'Year' and 'Month' were generated in base to the column 'Comments' using the functions grepl and math in R with the script `bd_cleaning.R`

- The database was open in `openRefine` for to unify the names and remove space and special characters

- The geographic coordinates were obtained from the names of the countries and locations using the API Google Maps in R with the script `coordenadas.R`
